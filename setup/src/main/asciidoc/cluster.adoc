= Cluster

The Raspberry PI needs several pieces of hardware and software to set it up.

== Hardware

The cluster for this demo uses:

PIs V3]. Each datacenter is made of 4 Raspberry PIs, as well as 4
Raspberry PIs for the clients

== Software

To setup the Raspberry PI Cluster you need the following tools to be
installed:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible]
(https://valdhaus.co/writings/ansible-mac-osx/[how to install it]
* The Hypriot https://github.com/hypriot/flash[flash utility]
* (optional) http://brewformulas.org/Pv[Pipe Viewer] to monitor the
progress of data (handy when flashing SD cards)
* (optional) https://gist.github.com/arunoda/7790979[SSHPASS]

== Setup the Physical Raspberry PI Cluster

For this demo, the cluster is setup as follow:

* Clients
** 3 Raspberry PIs acting as clients browsing the 2 data centers
(`pi-client-01`, `pi-client-02` and `pi-client-03`)
** 1 Load balancer for the clients (`pi-client-load-balancer`)
* Data center
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Warcraft#Thrall[Thrall]
** 1 load balancer (`pi-thrall-load-balancer`)
** 2 servers (`pi-thrall-server-01` and `pi-thrall-server-02`)
** 1 database (`pi-thrall-database`)
* Data center
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Warcraft#Grommash_Hellscream[Grom]
** 1 load balancer (`pi-grom-load-balancer`)
** 2 servers (`pi-grom-server-01` and `pi-grom-server-02`)
** 1 database (`pi-grom-database`)
