= Router

For this sample, we are going to use the https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/[Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X].
It’s a cheap router with a lot of features in it.
Any other router should work just fine, but the instructions detailed here are for the EdgeRouter X.

There are two ways of setting up the router: manually, or importing a config file

== Setup : Config file

=== Reset to Factory Settings

* Power on the Ubiquiti Router, place a paper clip or Pin into the hole on the back of the Router labeled Reset.
* Hold paper clip or pin down for 10 to 15 seconds and release.
* The Router will reboot on its own. Once the WLAN light stops blinking, the Router is reset.

=== Connect to the Router

* Plug your computer into eth0 on the router.
* Configure your computer to have the static IP and route.
The Router IP is `192.168.1.1`.

image:router-setup-01.png[Static IP]

* Open a browser and navigate to `https://192.168.1.1`.
You should get the login screen to access the Router console.
(You may need to trust the certificate first).
* Login with Username `ubnt` and Password `ubnt`.

=== Upload the configuration file

Go to `System` (button on the lower left corner) -> `Restore Config` -> `Upload a file` and pick up `setup/src/resources/router/edgeos_ubnt_20171105.tar.gz`

This will reboot the router (this takes a few minutes).

Change back you Eternet cable from eth0 to eth4, change your Mac netword back to DHCP (instead of manual) and go back to the router at https://10.99.99.1

== Setup : Manually

=== Reset to Factory Settings

* Power on the Ubiquiti Router, place a paper clip or Pin into the hole
on the back of the Router labeled Reset.
* Hold paper clip or pin down for 10 to 15 seconds and release.
* The Router will reboot on its own. Once the WLAN light stops blinking,
the Router is reset.

=== Connect to the Router

* Plug your computer into eth0 on the router.
* Configure your computer to have the static IP and route. The Router IP
is `192.168.1.1`.

image:router-setup-01.png[Static IP]

* Open a browser and navigate to `https://192.168.1.1`. You should get
the login screen to access the Router console. (You may need to trust
the certificate first).
* Login with Username `ubnt` and Password `ubnt`.

=== Setup DHCP Server

* The Router DHCP Server will provide your PI’s with Internet
Connection, by sharing a home Internet Connection.
* Go to Wizards / WAN + 2LAN2 to set up DHCP Server. Use a non
convential range like 10.99.99.1 to avoid clashing with other networks.
The DHCP will assign IP’s from 1 to 10.99.99.255.

image:router-setup-02.png[WAN + 2LAN2]

* Click `Apply` (then `Apply Changes` and `Reboot`). The Router should
restart with the new settings.
* Unplug your computer from the Router and connect your Home Internet in
eht0. Plug your computer into any of the other eth ports.
* Remove the static IP from your computer configuration. The router
should now assign you a Dynamic IP in the 10.99.99.x range.
* The Router is now available in `https://10.99.99.1`. You require to
change the browser address and relog to the Router console.


=== Map Static IP’s

* If you wish, you can assign static IP’s to your PI’s (not required,
but usefull if you want to make sure that you access the same PI with
the same IP everytime).
* Go to Services / LAN / Actions / View Details / Static MAC/IP Mapping.
* If it does not exist, create a new mapping with your IP address
(10.99.99.x) and Mac address (on OSX you get your Mac address from
Network preferences)

* In the Config Action for each Host you can set up the IP for the Host.

=== Hostname into Hosts files

* The Route has a hosts files to resolve DNS names.
* To be able to resolve Hostnames from boxes connecting to the Router,
we need to activate a configuration.
* Go to Config Tree / service / dhcp-server / hostfile-update, set to
``enable'', click on preview. (This will register the PI’s hostnames in
the hosts files and they will be reachable via DNS)
* Or you can use the following commands if you connect to the router
directly:

....
ssh ubnt@10.99.99.1

=== Adding Manual entries to Hosts file

* This operation can only be done in the CLI console.
* Useful to register multiple hostnames to the same IP. For instance a
`docker-registry` host running in your local box to provision the Docker
Images to run in the PI’s.

=== Add Hosts

The Demos in the project require certain services to run on a dedicated
box, for instance the Docker Registry or the ELK stack. The reason for
this is that some of the required dependencies do not run in the PI
Cluster due to the lack of hardware resources. Your working computer
should be OK to run these.

Some configuration points to a particular hostname where the service
should be running. By adding a host in the router you can point to where
the service can be found, either your local box or something else.

Required hosts:

....
set system static-host-mapping host-name docker-registry inet 10.99.99.10
set system static-host-mapping host-name elk inet 10.99.99.10
....

Remember to static map your box to the ip `10.99.99.10`.

=== Access the PIs with hostname

Now you should be able to ping the hostnames (and not just the physical IP addresses). For that:

* `ping pi-thrall-server-01`, `ping ppi-client-01`
* Connect to the router (`ssh ubnt@10.99.99.1` pwd `ubnt`) and check the hosts file (`cat /etc/hosts`)
* You should get something similar to that (notice that `#on-dhcp-event` is for dynamic IP, and `#vyatta` for static)

```
127.0.1.1        ubnt    #vyatta entry
10.99.99.38      docker-repo             #vyatta entry
10.99.99.38      agoncal                 #on-dhcp-event c:4d:e9:cb:82:db
10.99.99.47      pi-load-balancer        #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:e5:19:5e
10.99.99.44      pi-grom-server-01       #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:f5:88:47

10.99.99.48      pi-thrall-server-01     #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:af:ec:f0
10.99.99.43      pi-grom-server-02       #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:d7:e2:b4
10.99.99.45      pi-thrall-load-balancer #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:44:e7:58
10.99.99.46      pi-client-03            #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:f6:77:aa
10.99.99.41      pi-thrall-server-02     #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:d5:51:a6
10.99.99.40      pi-grom-load-balancer   #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:38:b5:3a
10.99.99.39      pi-client-02            #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:ff:d1:a4
10.99.99.42      pi-grom-database        #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:cb:ba:69
10.99.99.49      pi-thrall-database      #on-dhcp-event b8:27:eb:ff:45:4a
```

* You can now log on into your PIs with `ssh pirate@pi-thrall-load-balancer` (password `hypriot`)
* To make sure all the Rasperry PIs are up and running, use the Ansible command (make sure you `cd` into the `setup/ansible` directory, where the `hosts` file is located):
  * `ansible all -m ping -i hosts`
  * if you get "to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program" run `brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb`
  * if it still does not work, use `ansible all -m ping -i hosts -c paramiko` you should be prompted :

```
paramiko: The authenticity of host 'pi-thrall-database' can't be established.
The ssh-ed25519 key fingerprint is 6678299330f009a422c3aeadf9929da1.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
yes
```

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you can ping an IP address (eg. `10.99.99.39`) but not the hostname (eg. `pi-client-02`), try to reboot all your Raspberry PIs.
====

=== Troubleshooting

If you try to connect to the router through ssh and have the following error:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:ZgD1JUiD6OKEyu3TBRc7EEsf67vYkRsydyxyEF3X03g.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/antoniombp/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /Users/antoniombp/.ssh/known_hosts:40
RSA host key for 10.99.99.1 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

Just open the file `~/.ssh/known_hosts:40` and delete the line (here, line `40`). Save the file, and relog in.
