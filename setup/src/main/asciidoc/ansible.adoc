= Ansible

Ansible allows us to send commands in batch to all the PIs: ping them all, deploy an image and so on.

== Host

Ansible relies on the `setup/ansible/hosts` file where the host alias are defined:

```
[clients]
pi-client-01
pi-client-02
pi-client-03
```

== Ping

To ping all the PIs you can enter the following command:

```
$ ansible all -m ping -i hosts
```

== Troubleshooting

=== SSH

If you get

```
pi-client-03 | FAILED! => {
    "failed": true,
    "msg": "to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program"
}
```

Make sure you install https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32255660/how-to-install-sshpass-on-mac[sshpass].

=== SSH Key

If you try to ping the PIs and have the following error:

```
pi-grom-server-02 | FAILED! => {
    "msg": "Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this.  Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host."
}
```

That's because the PI does not have a SSH key defined on the router's `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file.
Log on into each PI with `ssh pirate@pi-thrall-load-balancer` (password `hypriot`) so the key is created.
