# Demo 02

This demo has an extra service to do CRUD operations on Books (`book-api`). It needs the service to retrieve an identification number for a product (`number-api`). It contains:

* Services
    * book-api (TomEE on port 8081)
    * number-api (Wildfly Swarm on port 8084)
* Client
    * Angular app (NGinx on port 8080)

To build the Angular App, execute:

## Cleaning Docker images

If you need to clean all the Docker images, use the following commands:

* `docker image ls |Â grep baking`
* `/bin/bash -c 'docker image rm $(docker image ls -q "baking/*") -f'`

## Build Angular

```bash
ng build --prod
```

## Build Services

To build the sample just run the Maven command from the Demo 01 root folder:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Run

You can run the Demo either Locally, with Docker, with Docker Compose, or in the PI Cluster.

The services are available at:
* `http://localhost:8081/book-api/api/`
* `http://localhost:8084/number-api/api/`

The client is available at:
* `http://localhost:8080`

### Locally

To run the services `number-api` and `book-api` locally, you can just run the uber jars sitting in the projects target 
folders with all the dependencies already packed in. The files are generated in the Build step. From the each of the 
root folders of the services run:

To run `number-api` locally.

```bash
java -jar target/number-api-02-swarm.jar
```

To run the `book-api` locally, 

```bash
java -jar target/book-api-02.jar
```

For the Angular application, use the developer's model in local and run:

```bash
ng serve
```

### Docker

To run the Demo with Docker, first the Docker Images need to be built. Run the Maven command From the 
Demo 02 root folder:

```bash
mvn docker:build
```

Then to start the services and the clients, then run:

```bash
mvn docker:start
```

This will start all the Docker Images for this Demo in background.

To stop the services and the clients, just run:

```bash
mvn docker:stop
```

### Docker Compose

On the root folder you will find a `docker-compose.yml` file. This will execute all the needed Docker images.

### Raspberry PI

To run on the Raspberry PI Cluster, first follow the steps in [Setup Raspberry PI Cluster](../setup/README.md). As 
described in the Setup, a Local Docker Registry is used to ease the deployment.

Push the Local built Docker Image into the Local Docker Registry: 

```bash
mvn docker:push '-Ddocker.filter=rpi'
```

#### Ansible
The Docker Images are then deployed into the PI's with [Ansible](http://ansible.com). From the `ansible` folder, run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy.yaml -vvv
```

The services are available at:
* `http://pi-grom-server-01:8081/book-api/api/`
* `http://pi-grom-server-01:8084/number-api/api/`

The client is available at:
* `http://pi-client-01:8080`
